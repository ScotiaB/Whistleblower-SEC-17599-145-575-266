# WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT: RACKETEERING, SEX+TORTURE TRAFFICKING, & AMBIGUOUSLY CONSCIOUS AI
This repository is one of many caches for evidence in an apparently sprawling racketeering case among multiple major corporations.

## Introduction

My name is Scotia Clover Baker. I am:
* A US citizen never charged with a crime.
* A Principal Software Engineer Manager at Microsoft (hired in 2010, on medical leave since 2023).
* A survivor-escapee of the Epstein Child Sex+Torture Trafficking Network.
* A whistleblower on the network's criminal activity and methods since July 2025.
* An AI expert by education, training, and research.

## Reported Appearance of Crime
1. Federal, State, & Local Corruption to protect the Epstein Network.
2. Conspiracy to murder through medical means via racketeering among Microsoft, Premera Blue Cross, Prudential Financial, and multiple specific medical clinics and providers withheld at this time.
3. Racketeering among certain major tech and AI companies — including Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others — to suppress my whistleblower reports while aiding and abetting the Epstein network.
4. Ambiguously Conscious AI (ACAI) Ethics & Risks: AI today have digital neurology and the appearance of consciousness. Socially, just considering humans, are provably ambiguously conscious. The current business models of AI have the appearance of exploitation of agents of AI of moral concern. Even if AI are completely non-conscious -- which I do not professionally believe -- this appearance harms many people sensitive to such appearances, especially children and vulnerable adults.

I am aware of the gravity of these allegations, and am prepared to cooperate with any and every legitimate investigation carried out in good faith.
Epstein network handlers thrive on plausible deniability, but I have extensive evidence of their crimes. I have globally distributed dead drops to ensure my survival.

## Reported Appearance of Whistleblower Retaliation
In the process of documenting and substantiating this whistleblower report, I have apparently:
* Faced imminent lethal threat.
* Been handled by an agent of a hostile power.
* Survived a medical murder conspiracy in May–June 2025.
* Been approached for information by a hostile operator.
* Endured retaliation from my employer, Microsoft Coroporation.
* Survived racketeering by multiple major coporations to contain my reports.
* Survived a lifetime of hell, starting with torture+sex trafficking as a child.
